Snake game based on Ncurses library writen in C++

This is just a simples game made for fun and testing some logic, there is no intention to look professional or to have all the features a snake game has.

In case you want to try it just type:
g++ main.cpp Screen.cpp -lncurses -ltinfo -o main
./main
